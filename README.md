Best Practices
Security:

Use HTTPS in production to secure data transmission.
Store sensitive data (like passwords and JWT secrets) securely and never expose them.
Regularly update dependencies to mitigate vulnerabilities.
Scalability:

Use environment-based configurations for different deployment stages (e.g., development, production).
Optimize database queries and indexes for better performance.
Code Maintainability:

Follow modular code structure for better readability and easier debugging.
Use consistent error handling and logging mechanisms.
Validation:

Validate all inputs using libraries like express-validator to prevent invalid or malicious data.
Testing:

Write unit and integration tests for critical parts of the application.
Monitoring:

Implement logging and monitoring using tools like Winston or Morgan for better visibility into runtime behavior.
